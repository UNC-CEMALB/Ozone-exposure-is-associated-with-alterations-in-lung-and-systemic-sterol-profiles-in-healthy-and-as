# Confusion Matrix Figure (Figure 5)
- Visualization of confusion matrix metrics from all supervised machine learning models tested (KNN, SVM, and RF)

# Decision Boundary Plot (Figure 6)
- Visualization of two of the most significant predictors in lung response RF models (ie. Chol and Vitamin D) to determine how well those variables could predict lung response status

# Variable Importance Plot (not in manuscript)
- Shows the top predictors in random forest models relative to random noise
