# Inflammatory and Lung Response Prediction (Table 6 & Table S3-S5)
- Using the supervised machine learning method, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), or K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to predict inflammatory or lung response class (non-responder or responder) based on sterol and cytokine concentrations derived from plasma prior to ozone exposure
- Variable importance rankings were extracted from RF models
